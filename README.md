# examTimer
My first[^1] attempt using JavaScript.

I have long wanted a clock that I can display during in-class assessments that shows the current time, end time, and automatically calculates and displays the end time for any students with 25% extra time.

This is it!

[^1]: Technically, I used a bit of JavaScript while working at university but that was for something even smaller than this so it doesn't count.
